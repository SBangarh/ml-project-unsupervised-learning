# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.
### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes
### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
-	Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked."

## Goals
1. Continue to apply python best practices
2. Develop EDA techniques a bit more - explore other ways to handle outliers and nulls,
3. Work to increase efficiency using functions and data pipelines
4. Develop a unsupervised ML model to cluster my data
5. Have fun

## Process
First thing I did was import my libraries and develop functions for my EDA. These functions ranged from understanding the data to visualizing the data. I performed EDA using these functions and explored the data using a top down approach. I started at the dataframe level to understand the data and build visuals to communicate the data. I went to feature specific level after determining relationships and behaviours across the channels and regions.

I identified outliers using code and boxplots. I explored removing the outliers, median imputation, log transformation, and winsorization. I proceeded with the data after winsorization.

## Results

## Challenges
1. Understanding the backend of the models I used. I need to invest more time in theory than code.
2. ambiguity, I'm getting more comfortable with it, but still can improve.
3. establishing a workflow - things got murky when we started supervised learning
4. 

## Future goals
1. improve my understanding of the theory behind the models and how it works
2. apply models I have learned to data that is not project related
